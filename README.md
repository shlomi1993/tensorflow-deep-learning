# TensorFlow Deep Learning - Training and Milestones

Welcome to the **TensorFlow Deep Learning** repository!  

This repository is a fork of [mrdbourke's TensorFlow Deep Learning repository](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning).  
I followed the [TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=JUST4U02223), and this repository served as a companion to the course.  

I've modified this repo to include my implementations and solutions for the three milestone projects in the course.  
These implementations helped me gain some hands-on experience with TensorFlow and Keras, reinforcing my understanding of deep learning concepts ðŸš€

The implemented milestones are:
**1. Milestone 1 - Food Vision Bigâ„¢** - Scaling up a deep learning model using **transfer learning** and **fine-tuning** on the full **Food101** dataset. Exploring how increasing data volume impacts model performance, helping to build a more robust food classification system capable of distinguishing between 101 food categories with high accuracy.  
**2. Milestone 2 - [placeholder]**
**3. Milestone 3 - [placeholder]**

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras (included in TensorFlow 2.x)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended)

You can install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements_mac.txt
```

### Execute Project

To execute a project that downloads a dataset, builds a model, trains it on the dataset, and makes predictions and evaluations, clone the repository and navigate to the `milestones/` directory. Then install the Python requirements and execute Python as follows:
```sh
git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/tensorflow-bootcamp.git](https://github.com/shlomi1993/tensorflow-deep-learning.git)
cd tensorflow-deep-learning/milestones
pip install -r requirements_mac.txt
PYTHONPATH=. python3 ./<project-milestone-dir>/main.py
```
